<!-- Understanding the Power of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript: -->

In TypeScript, union and intersection types are two essential concepts that bring flexibility and precision to our code. These types allow developers to handle data in dynamic, type-safe ways, which leads to cleaner and more reliable applications. Letâ€™s discus why union and intersection types are important and how they can improve our TypeScript development.

<!-- Union type:  -->
Union types let a variable hold multiple possible types, making our code more flexible. For example, if you have a function that can accept different types of input, a union type can combine these types into one. Without union types, we would have to write separate functions for each type. Union types help solve this problem by allowing us to specify that a value can be of multiple types.

To define a union type, use the pipe (|) symbol between each type.

<!-- Example:  -->

type somePrimitiveTypes = string | number | boolean;

function formatInput(input : somePrimitiveTypes) : somePrimitiveTypes{

  return`Input: ${input}`

}

console.log(formatInput("Hello"));   // Output: "Input: Hello"

<!-- Intersection Type: -->
Intersection types combine multiple types into one type that requires all properties from each type. This is useful when you need a variable to meet multiple requirements.

To define an intersection type, use the ampersand (&) symbol between each type.

<!-- Example:  -->

type User = { name: string };
type Admin = { role: string };

type Person = User & Admin;

function describePerson(person: Person): string {
    return `${person.name} is ${person.role}.`;
}

const person: Person = { name: "Alice", role: "Administrator" };

console.log(describePerson(person)); // Output: "Alice has the role of Administrator."


Union and intersection types make TypeScript more flexible and powerful. Union types give us flexibility, while intersection types provide structure and precision. Together, they help us write cleaner, safer, and more efficient code, which makes us TypeScript applications more reliable and easier to maintain.
